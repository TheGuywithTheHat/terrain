# Terrain
A 3D terrain simulator with heavy dependency on shaders

## Current features

 - Chunk-based infinite terrain, generated by a heightmap made with 2D perlin noise.
 - Directional sunlight and moonlight.
 - Fairly realistic sky color gradient, including a smooth transition to an orange horizon at sunrise and sunset.
 - Dynamic wave textures generated with 3D perlin noise.
 - Beaches, mountains, and snow.
